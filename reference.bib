In some ways, the game can foster a love for and curiosity about nature. In other ways, the game reinforces harmful colonialist values and attitudes that are ultimately an obstacle to conservation in the real world. Here I critique the game values relevant to conservation, both the values that benefit and the values that hinder conservation. I discuss possibilities for a future version of the game that reinforces values better aligned with conservation.}, number={3}, journal={Highlights of Sustainability}, year={2022}, month=jul, pages={129–133} }

@article{Rennick_Clinton_Ioannidou_Oh_Clooney_T._Healy_Roberts, title={Gender bias in video game dialogue}, volume={10}, ISSN={2054-5703}, url={https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10206463/}, DOI={10.1098/rsos.221095}, abstractNote={Gender biases in fictional dialogue are well documented in many media. In film, television and books, female characters tend to talk less than male characters, talk to each other less than male characters talk to each other, and have a more limited range of things to say. Identifying these biases is an important step towards addressing them. However, there is a lack of solid data for video games, now one of the major mass media which has the ability to shape conceptions of gender and gender roles. We present the Video Game Dialogue Corpus, the first large-scale, consistently coded corpus of video game dialogue, which makes it possible for the first time to measure and monitor gender representation in video game dialogue. It demonstrates that there is half as much dialogue from female characters as from male characters. Some of this is due to a lack of female characters, but there are also biases in who female characters speak to, and what they say. We make suggestions for how game developers can avoid these biases to make more inclusive games.}, number={5}, journal={Royal Society Open Science}, author={Rennick, Stephanie and Clinton, Melanie and Ioannidou, Elena and Oh, Liana and Clooney, Charlotte and T., E. and Healy, Edward and Roberts, Seán G.}, pages={221095} }

The sample included 150 games from a year across nine platforms, with the results weighted according to game sales. This innovation enabled the results to be analyzed in proportion to the games that were actually played by the public, and thus allowed the first statements able to be generalized about the content of popular video games. The results show a systematic over-representation of males, white and adults and a systematic under-representation of females, Hispanics, Native Americans, children and the elderly. Overall, the results are similar to those found in television research. The implications for identity, cognitive models, cultivation and game research are discussed.}, number={5}, journal={New Media & Society}, author={Williams, Dmitri and Martins, Nicole and Consalvo, Mia and Ivory, James D.}, year={2009}, month=aug, pages={815–834}, language={en} }

The present systematic review investigates the role of haptics for the hearing impaired in training or gamified activities. We applied a set of keywords to the Scopus® and PubMed® databases, obtaining a collection of 35 manuscripts spanning 23 years. Each article has been categorized following a documented procedure and thoroughly analyzed. Our findings reveal a rising number of studies in this field in the last five years, mostly testing the effectiveness of the developed rehabilitative method (77.14%). Despite a wide variety in almost every category we analyzed, such as haptic devices, body location, and data collection, we report a constant difficulty in recruitment, reflected in the low number of hearing-impaired participants (mean of 8.31). This review found that in all six papers reporting statistically significant positive results, the vibrotactile device in use generated vibrations starting from a sound, suggesting that some perceptual aspects connected to sound are transmittable through touch. This fact provides evidence that haptics and vibrotactile devices could be viable solutions for hearing-impaired rehabilitation and training.}, number={1}, journal={Multimodal Technologies and Interaction}, author={Ganis, Francesco and Gulli, Andrea and Fontana, Federico and Serafin, Stefania}, year={2023}, month=dec, pages={1}, language={en} }

With this popularity, attention has been directed towards the accessibility of these technologies to people with disabilities to ensure equity, equal access to opportunities and realize earnings from a significant customer group. This study investigates: How is the attention of academic game accessibility research divided across game technologies, disability categories and use domains? And where is attention needed? To answer these questions, I conducted a review of research (162 manuscripts) on game technologies’ accessibility published between 2016 and 2020, inclusive. The reviewed literature appears to have a utility focus (e.g. on education and health management) that relatively de-emphasizes the importance of game accessibility for entertainment or fun purposes. Auditory, motor and mobility disabilities, and emerging gamification, exergames, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are especially under researched in the academic domain.}, number={4}, journal={New Media & Society}, author={Hassan, Lobna}, year={2024}, month=apr, pages={2336–2384}, language={en} }
